QuillQuest is a minimalistic Twitter clone

The idea behind this name is to evoke the imagery of a quill, which is a classic writing tool, symbolizing the act of writing and sharing thoughts. The word “Quest” suggests a journey or search, which in the context of your project, could represent the pursuit of concise and meaningful communication.

Quill: Represents writing, expression, and the traditional roots of communication.

Quest: Implies a continuous search for knowledge, interaction, and community engagement.
